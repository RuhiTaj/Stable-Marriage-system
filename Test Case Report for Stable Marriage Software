Module Name: giveResult()	Test Executed By: Team
Test Title: Outputting a stable match	Test Execution Date: 30 -03-17
Description: This function takes a preference matrix as input and outputs the stable matching by applying Gale-Shapely algorithm.	
	
	
Preconditions: The user must select give result option only when no. of brides is same as no. of bridegrooms.
Dependencies: It depends on the stableMarriageTest to provide it with the preference matrix.
